# Dust-Mail

Dust-Mail is a free and open source project that aims to replace all desktop and web email clients by providing a fast and simple experience. It uses an intuitive design built using React on the frontend and Rust in the backend to be able to handle all of your email safely and quickly.

Currently the project is still in a very early stage and using it in a production environment is generally discouraged.

I am working on this project all alone, so donations are of course very welcome.
